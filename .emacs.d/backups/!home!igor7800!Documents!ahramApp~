[color=red][b]Player Information[/b][/color]
Hello, my name is Igor and i'm originally from Russia, but was living in Denmark for quite of bit of time. I can speak Russian, Danish and English languages, so i can translate from Russian if needed. I'm 24 years old and i'm studying electronical engineering at an university of Aalborg, so i playing EvE not so often when i have exams. I also like powerlifting and bench press in particular, it goes something like this: [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx69MyCNsqU[/url] .
I'm playing mostly on weekends and afternoons on the working days. 

[color=red][b]Eve History[/b][/color]
First i joined some mining corp, but short time after a Russian hisec corp picked me up and learned me what's EvE was about.
After some period of time our allies offered us live with them in wormhole (c2 with  hisec and c4) system. I have been there for a while, and then our corp migrated to zero space and joined NoValue alliance, witch joined to Shadow of XXDeathXX short time after. But when Shadow of XXDeathXX fall my corp decided to go to NPC space, i didn't liked that decision, so i moved back to wormhole with my old friends. After some month they quit eve because of real life issues and corp became dead. So me and my other friend joined corp living in (c2 with hisec and c3), witch was fun, we had a lot of small gang engagements. Last 2 month i have being living in my own C3 system with hisec, because of the lack of time and loads of exams :)
So i have only saw the Russian side of EvE community, but it's always fun to meet some new people and make new friends, so i decided to join English speaking wh corp.
